# Decision Trees (Supervised Learning)

# Goal

Explore the power of decision tree  models

# Data

Breast cancer dataset

# Results


Achieve better accuracy score for test data set when increasing the depth of the tree (avoid overfitting),  by pre-pruning techniques. 

Decison trees alloww to better visualize the results by feature importance.

The most important features  is "worst radius"

# Conclusion

Decision trees have 2 advatages: 1) the model can be easily vusualized and understood 2) no need for data scaling or preprocessing

### One  disadvantage:
    Even with pre-pruning, the mdel can still overfit
### Solution:
        Ensemble method of decision trees.
